# avalon-fire

realtime avalon with rooms, using firebase and react ()

## TODO

-   [ ] replace ant design with mui/nextui/maybe something else? to use some ui stuff that is isn't in antd (collapsible, different checkbox management, etc)
-   [ ] implement actual game logic
    -   [ ] keep track of votes, turn, fails, etc
-   [ ] restructure file system
-   [ ] possible google/facebook login when public
-   [ ] simpler room IDs
-   [ ] refactor to automatically deconstruct props, look into moving some state around

## v2??

-   [ ] typescript
-   [ ] multiple routes for each state, instead of a single page app (next.js possibly?)
-   [ ] custom component library
-   [ ] supabase realtime (learn postgres basics first)
